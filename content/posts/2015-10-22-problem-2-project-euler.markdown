The [problem](https://projecteuler.net/problem=2) requires the sum of all even-numbered Fibonacci numbers that are less than four million.

Our solution is made easier by the existing mathematical proof that every third number in a Fibonacci sequence is even.

Therefore our solution requires us to sum every third number in the sequence until the given limit of four million.
