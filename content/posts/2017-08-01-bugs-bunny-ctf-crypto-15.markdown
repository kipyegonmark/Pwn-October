## Bugs Bunny CTF - Crypto-15
### Problem

Some classics crypto task ! Cesar maybe !!

crypto-15.txt

### Solution

The text file __crypto-15.txt__ seems to be python code encrypted using a Caesar cipher. Of particular interest is the string Cvht_Cvooz{D35bS_3OD0E3_4S3_O0U_T3DvS3_BU_4MM} that follows the flag format.

Applying a shift by 12 returns the flag

FLAG: _Bugs\_Bunny{C35aR\_3NC0D3\_4R3\_N0T\_S3CuR3\_AT\_4LL}_
