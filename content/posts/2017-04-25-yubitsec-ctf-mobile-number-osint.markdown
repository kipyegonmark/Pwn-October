### Solution

A reverse image search of the picture leads to the profile of 
[Isaac Kasamani](http://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/newly-arrived-refugees-from-south-sudan-receive-a-portion-news-photo/666947726#newly-arrived-refugees-from-south-sudan-receive-a-portion-of-sorghum-picture-id666947726), a Ugandan photojournalist.
